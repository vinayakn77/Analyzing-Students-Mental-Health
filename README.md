# Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health


In analyzing data from a Japanese university's survey conducted in 2018, it was observed that international students face a higher risk of mental health issues compared to the general population. The study, which received ethical and regulatory approval, revealed that social connectedness and acculturative stress significantly influence depression among international students.

Upon examining the data using PostgreSQL, it was found that international students who stayed for the maximum duration of 10 years exhibited the highest average depression test score (Avg Score = 13). However, they obtained the lowest score for social connectedness (Avg Score = 32), indicating a lack of integration into social groups. Despite this, their acculturative stress test scores ranked in the lower second position (SCS = 50), suggesting a relatively good adaptability to the new culture.

This analysis suggests that prolonged stays among international students may exacerbate feelings of depression, although they demonstrate better adaptability due to increased social interaction with domestic students and locals over time.
